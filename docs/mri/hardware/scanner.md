# MRI Specifications and Equipment

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)** is a medical imaging technique that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to generate detailed images of organs and tissues inside the body. The CHBH houses a SIEMENS MAGNETOM PRISMA 3T installed in January 2019. 

The scanner can be used to assess brain activity and function through several techniques:

- **Structural MRI** is used to produce high-resolution anatomical images

- **Functional MRI (fMRI)** measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood oxygen levels

- **Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)** maps brain connectivity through white matter tracts

- **Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)** measures levels of molecules including metabolites and neurotransmitters

    The CHBH houses 20-channel, [32-channel](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/en-uk/magnetic-resonance-imaging/options-and-upgrades/coils/32-channel-head-coil) and [64-channel](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/en-us/magnetic-resonance-imaging/options-and-upgrades/coils/64-channel-head-neck-coil) head coils.

The CHBH also has equipment for combining MR with simultaneous behavioural and physiological assessment.
