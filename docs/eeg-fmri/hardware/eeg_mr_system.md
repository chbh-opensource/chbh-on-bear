### Amplifiers
At the CHBH, we have three BrainProducts MRI-compatible amplifiers:

- **2 × 32-channel [MR BrainAmps](https://www.brainproducts.com/solutions/brainamp-mr/)** 
- **1 × [MR EXG BrainAmp](https://brainvision.com/products/brainamp-exg-mr/)** 

We also have two MRI-compatible [PowerPacks](https://brainvision.com/products/powerpack/), enabling:
- 64-channel EEG recordings  
- **Carbon Wire Loop (CWL)** recordings  
- **Peripheral recordings**, such as EOG

### EEG Caps
We have three MRI-compatible 64-channel EEG caps ([BrainCap MR](https://www.brainproducts.com/solutions/braincap-mr/)) with integrated CWL. 
Sizes available:

- Small  
- Medium  
- Large  

These caps are also suitable for **MEG-EEG** and **TMS-EEG** recordings.

### Triggering
To send triggers to the amplifiers we use BrainProduct's [TriggerBox](https://www.brainproducts.com/solutions/triggerbox/), which connects directly to the recording laptop.

### Scanner Synchronization
EEG data collected inside of the scanner is corrupted by various MRI related artifacts. To help remove these artifacts in post-processing, we synchronise the EEG acquisition with the scanner clock using BrainProduct's [SyncBox](https://www.brainproducts.com/solutions/syncbox/).
