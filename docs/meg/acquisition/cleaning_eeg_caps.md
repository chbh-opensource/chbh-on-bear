# Cleaning EEG caps / Makeup & EEG gel removal

**<p style="font-size:20px; ">Please <span style="color:red"> do not</span> use the <span style="color:red">toilet sinks</span> for any of the following purposes.**</p>

## Cleaning EEG caps

**Use** the <span style="color:blue">**ground floor shower **</span> (just outside the MEG corridor) sink,  or the <span style="color:blue">**first floor shower**</span> sink for cleaning the EEG caps.

**Clean the caps** immediately after each use, ideally **before** the electrolyte gel/paste starts **drying**. 

!!! info "The dried gel reduces the signal tranductance of an electrode and is a common reason for bad impedance/bad signal strength."

- **Fill** sink with lukewarm water.
- **Submerge only the cap**. <span style="color:red">**DO NOT**</span> allow the connector boxes/end connectors to get wet. Let the cap **sit in the water for a few minutes**.
- In case of **more persistent/greasy stains**, use **mild detergents**, **pure soap**, or **baby shampoo**, and clean the caps in lukewarm soapy water.
	 - **Rinse thoroughly** with water after cleaning.
	 - <span style="color:red">**DO NOT**</span> use **dish detergents** - *will alter the electrode surface*.
- **Clean the gel** from the electrodes **using a cotton swab or soft toothbrush**. 
	 - Alternatively, **run each electrode**, in turn, **under running lukewarm water**.<br /> *The water pressure will force most of the gel from the electrodes*.
- **Rinse the cap thoroughly, BUT CAREFULLY!!** See <span style="color:maroon">**Handling and Maintenance**</span> information section below.
- **Blot dry** using a **towel**, or **green paper towel**.
- **Place green paper towel** on the **correctly-sized polystyrene head** (which can found in a box on top of the cupboards in Side Room), and **carefully fit the cap over it** to dry.
	 - Make sure the **connector boxes/end connectors** are **kept away from any chance of water drippage**.
- **When the cap is dry**, replace it in its box, and put box back in the right-hand white cabinet in the Control Room.
- **Return** the polystyrene head to its box on the cupboard.

!!! note
	A **small hairdryer** may also be used to **quickly dry** a cap. However, **use only the *warm* setting**. The **high** or **hot** settings on some hair dryers are too hot and will weaken the elastic material - severely shortening the cap life.

- A **disinfectant** for the EEG caps - **[Perfektan TB](../../meg/pdfs/Perfektan_TB.pdf)** (found on shelf in right-hand white cabinet in Control Room) is **available if required**.
	 - **Follow the instructions** with/on the bottle.
		 - **Use** the **minimum concentration** and **soak** for the the **minimum time** required. **Make sure** that the cap is **fully immersed in the disinfectant**.
		 - **Do not** leave the cap in the disinfecting solution **longer than necessary**.
		 - **Do not** let the **connector boxes/end connectors get wet**.
	- **Rinse** the cap in clean water thoroughly afterwards.
	- **Leave** cap to dry as above.

!!! info "Any disinfection is more stressful to the materials than simple cleaning. However, caps and electrodes will not be ruined by disinfection. Rather, disinfection will accelerate premature aging of the cap.<br />Dry air by itself is a very good disinfectant. Most viruses and bacteria will not survive in a dry environment at room temperature for more than a few minutes."

!!! info
	**<span style="font-size:medium;color:maroon">Handling and Maintenance</span>**<br />
	
	- The **lifespan** of our EEG caps, and our reusable electrodes/HPI coils, **depends on handling**.
	- The most **critical spot** of an EEG cap electrode is where **the elastic cable goes into the solid electrode housing and into the plug** - please <span style="color:red">**DO NOT**</span> overstretch/overbend this section.
	- **EEG caps are**, and will stay, **non-magnetic if handled correctly**. However, they **do contain soft metals which will become magnetic if exposed to a magnetic field**.
		- <span style="color:red">**NEVER**</span> take the caps **near an MR-scanner**.
		- **Avoid** placing the cap **near an incandescent light bulb**, or a **Mains power wall socket**.
		- **Do not** allow caps **to get dusty** - *ordinary household dust can be ferromagnetic.*
	- **If the electrodes** in the cap do **become (slightly) magnetised**, in the majority of cases they can be **made MEG-compatible** again by **simply rewashing/cleaning the cap**.


## Makeup and Electrode Gel removal

**Escort** Participant to one of the **shower** rooms to **wash off** any electrode gel, or **for makeup removal** prior to Acquiring.<br />**Remember to take swipe card!**

- **Towel** and **hair dryer** are in the Changing Room **wardrobe**.
- **Makeup removal** cotton pads, *Micellar* water **are available**.
- **Leave** the **used** towel on the **drying rack** in the Changing Room for MEG Support to deal with.
