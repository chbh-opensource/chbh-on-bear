# Fixing Noisy Channels

If, on starting Acquisition, you **<span style="color:maroon">encounter a noisy channel</span>**, after installing your participant in the gantry chair and your **empty room check** was fine beforehand ... <br />

<br />


* Hopefully you would have confirmed your participant was clean of any metal (*correct use of* ***both*** *metal detectors*).
* Ask your participant to open/close their mouth (*dental artefacts*).
* Ask your participant to blink their eyes once per second (*eye makeup artefact*).
* Ask your participant to take 2 deep breaths (*clothing arefefact*).


<span style="color:blue">First thing to try would be a **channel reset**</span>.<br />

* From the Acquisition Menu Bar, choose ...
	* **`Tools -> Reset Channels`**

The noisy channel may return to normal after the reset artefact has passed through.

<span style="color:blue">If not, try **heating the sensor**.</span>

- Stop any ongoing Acquisition by pressing the **`Stop`** button.
- From the Menu Bar, choose **`Tools -> Tuner`**.
- Load the latest Tuning file **`File -> Load Tunings ->`** Select **OK** (to load the default tuning file **He_90.tnp**).
- Select **`Measure Noise.`**
- In the **`View Channel`** window, replace the word **`ALL`** with the noisy channel in question e.g. **`MEG0923`**, press **`Enter`**.
- From the Menu Bar, choose **`Commands -> Heat sensor`**. Wait for the buffer to be reprocessed... **noise level should hopefully show a reduction**.
- Select **`Stop measurement`**, then **`Stop Collector`**.
- From the Menu Bar, choose **`File -> Exit ->`** **Yes** to close the Tuner window.
- Start Acquisition, check if channel is still noisy.


<span style="color:blue">If the sensor is still noisy, perform a **[RAP]**</span>.

- Once done, then ...
- Restart Acquisition.
- From the Menu Bar, choose **`Tools -> Tuner`**.
- Load the latest Tuning file **`File -> Load Tunings ->`** Select **OK** (to load the default tuning file **He_90.tnp**).
- Select **`Measure Noise`** to see if the **RAP** has reduced the channel noise level.
- If not, try another **RAP** and then repeat from "Restart Acquisition" above.


<span style="color:blue">If the sensor is still noisy, do a **soft reboot/reset** of the electronics, as per **[RESTART ACQUISITION (Resetting the electronics)]**</span>

- Exit Acquisition back to the Console login screen. 
- Open the Electronics Cabinet.
- Press the **Reset** button on the **[System Controller Card]**, as shown by the arrow.
- Confirm all cards/boards are reset (all are showing <span style="color:green">**GREEN**</span> LEDS) - takes 20-30sec.
- Close the Electronics cabinet door.
- Perform a **RAP**, then make sure the deafult tuning file is reloaded...
	- **Acquisition -> Tuner -> Load Tunings -> Measure Noise**.


<span style="color:blue">If the sensor is still noisy, **contact MEG Support** to attend to power down then restart the electronics</span>.

!!! info "Dr. Chris Bailey, former MEG Lab Manager at Aarhus University, Denmark, had this to say re: "noisy" participants ...back in 2018."
	*First, I’d try to figure out whether the artefacts are body motion-related. Ask the participant to keep completely still, and hold their breath while you count slowly to ten. 
	At ’two’, hit “Reset channels”. If the sensors return to something sane (non-saturated) after the reset-artefact has passed, there’s likely something magnetic on or in the participant.<br /><br />
	The Reset is needed if the source is very strong: the SQUID’s operating points will be screwed in a very strong static field. You can also try without the Reset, just ask them to hold (Very) still.<br /><br />
	We routinely use Hospital scrubs, at least the blouse. Hair wash is probably less likely to help, but getting all pins and clips out is important. A recent MRI will be a problem if there’s magnetic material inside the subject. 
	Finally, women with bras need to be asked whether they have a metal support, many do. Most artefacts will clearly be breathing-correlated, so that usually helps locating external sources.*
