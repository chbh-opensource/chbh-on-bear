# Moving the Gantry

<big>**<span style="color:red">Never change the gantry position whilst a particiant is seated under the gantry!</span>**</big>

**<span style="color:red">NOTE:</span>** For all **"in use" positions (0, 60 & 68)**, traffic light should show <span style="color:green">**solid** GREEN</span> LED.   
**<span style="color:red">NOTE:</span>** In the **liquefaction position (25)**, traffic light should show <span style="color:green">**flashing** GREEN</span> LED.

**After liquefaction has stopped (~9:0am), set the probe unit to the desired measurement position to be able to start a MEG measurement.**

* **<span style ="color:red">Make sure that no one is underneath the gantry during the position change and that the gantry can move freely up to the lower seated position.</span>**

* Press the **UP** button on the back side of the probe unit for a few seconds.
	* The amber **Tension** LED comes on to show that the probe unit is released from the latches.
* Keep pressing the **UP** button until you hear the latches lock into the **60** (*lower seated*) position.
* Press the **DOWN** button until the pobe unit stops over the latches and the green **OK** LED comes on.
	* If any other LED remains lit, press the **UP** or **DOWN** buttons as necessary to adjust the gantry position.

* Press the **UP** button on the back side of the probe unit for a few seconds.
	* The amber **Tension** LED comes on to show that the gantry is released from the latches.
* Pull down the latch release bar on the back of the probe unit, and keep it pulled down.	
* Keep pressing the **UP** button past the lower seated position (60) until the gantry reaches the upper seated position (68) and the movement stops.
* Press the **DOWN** button until the gantry stops over the latches and the green **OK** LED comes on.
	* If any other LED remains lit, press the **UP** or **DOWN** buttons as necessary to adjust the gantry position.

* **<span style ="color:red">Make sure that no one is underneath the gantry during the position change and that the gantry can move freely to the supine position.</span>**

* Press the **UP** button on the back side of the probe unit for a few seconds.
	* The amber **Tension** LED comes on to show that the gantry is released from the latches.
* Pull down the latch release bar on the back of the probe unit and keep it pulled down.
* Press the **DOWN** button until the gantry passes the liquefaction position (25) and stops over the latches at the supine position (0) and the green **OK** LED comes on.
	* After the gantry has rotated downwards and passed the 25째 position, you can release your hand from the latch bar.
	* If any other LED remains lit, press the **UP** or **DOWN** buttons as necessary to adjust the gantry position.

**When MEG measurements have finished for the day, move the probe unit to the liquefaction position (25) to allow liquefaction to run efficiently.**

* **<span style="color:red">Make sure that no one is underneath the gantry during the position change and that the gantry can move freely to the liquefaction position.</span>**

* Press the **UP** button on the back side of the probe unit until you hear the latches lock into the liquefaction (25) position.
* Press the **DOWN** button until the probe unit stops over the latches and the green **OK** LED starts flashing.
	* If any other LED remains lit, press the **UP** or **DOWN** buttons as necessary to adjust the gantry position.

* Keep pressing the **DOWN** button. When the probe unit has passed the 60째 position latches, release the latch release bar without releasing the **DOWN** button.
	* If you started from the lower seated position, the probe unit passes the 60째 position latches in about 3 seconds of driving down.
	* If you started from the upper seated position, the probe unit passes the 60째 position latches in about 6 seconds of driving down.
* With the latch release bar released, keep pressing the **DOWN** button until you hear the latches lock into the liquefaction (25) position.
* Keep pressing the **DOWN** button until the gantry stops over the latches and the green **OK** LED starts flashing.
