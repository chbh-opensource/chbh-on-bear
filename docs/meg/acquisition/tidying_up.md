# Tidying Up

### **<span style="color:blue">Tidying Up e.g. before next Operator</span>**

**End of day “to do” procedures shown in <span style="color:#FF5733">ORANGE</span><br /> - if you're the last Operator of the day (according to Calpendo).**

**<span style="color:blue">SUMMARY</span>**

- UPSs in place, to remain powered/protecting equipment. REO Isolation Transformer removed.
- EyeLink Host PC to be shut down after use, the 6-way Mains extension bar plug then switched off (to power off Camera).
- EyeLink batteries charged/used as normal. Don't leave switched on/charging overnight. Make sure the AC Adapter in the Stimulus Cabinet is switched off.
- PROPixx projector to remain powered, to be "awakened" or "slept" as necessary. Lens cover can be left off.
- STIM PC to remain powered, leave switched to NEW Stim via KVM at End of Day (a screensaver is set to protect monitor).
- NAtA Response Box Controller to remain powered up.
- All other Tiding Up as per our usual procedures...
	 - L2V Converters switched off after use.
	 - HPI coils cleaned.
	 - Polhemus cabling left tidy, L2V FO cabling/NAtA Response Box FO cabling/EyeLink cabling, left tidy in MSR.
	 - Log out of the DACQ Console, switch off the DACQ Console monitor once login screen appears.
	 - Fill out a Maintenance Log report for your session (one report for each session, if you have consecutive sessions).
	 - Move the gantry to 25, if you're the last Operator of the day/End of Day, or more than ~1hr between daily booked slots (check Calpendo).

**<span style="font-size:medium;color:green">Remember to check Calpendo to see if another Operator has booked the next session after yours;<br />in that case, you may be able to leave some equipment powered up.</span>**
