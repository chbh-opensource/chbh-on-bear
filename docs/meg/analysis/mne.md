# MNE Python

**[MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html) is a Python package for analysing electrophysiology (MEG, EEG, sEEG, ECoG, NIRS, etc) data.**

## MNE-Python Versions

[BEAR Apps](https://bear-apps.bham.ac.uk/applications/MNE-Python/) has several versions of MNE-Python as modules.

## BEAR Modules

The following `bash` loads `mne` version 1.3.1 and its dependencies - an equivalent is availiable for JupyterLab.

``` shell
module load bear-apps/2022a
module load MNE-Python/1.3.1-foss-2022a
```

!!! note
    Note that MNE-Python depends on a number of other python applications that will be loaded automatically. The above code will also load `numpy`, `scipy`, `numba`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn` and many other packages that are needed by MNE into your environment.

```python
import mne
import numpy as np
```

## MNE in a virtual environment

If you want to use a specific version of MNE-Python that isn't supported by BEAR, you can install it into a virtual environment. This `bash` script provides an example. We load Python 3.9.5, create an environment and install MNE into the environment using `pip`.

``` slurm
#!/bin/bash

module purge;
module load bear-apps/2022a
module load MNE-Python/1.3.1-foss-2022a
module load IPython/7.25.0-GCCcore-10.3.0

export VENV_DIR="${HOME}/virtual-environments"
export VENV_PATH="${VENV_DIR}/mne-example-${BB_CPU}"

# Create master dir if necessary
mkdir -p ${VENV_DIR}
echo ${VENV_PATH}

# Check if virtual environment exists and create it if not
if [[ ! -d ${VENV_PATH} ]]; then
    python3 -m venv --system-site-packages ${VENV_PATH}
fi

# Activate virtual environment
source ${VENV_PATH}/bin/activate

# Any additional installations
pip install mne==1.1.0
```

As with other examples, this can be copied directly into the terminal or saved as an shell script that can be executed in a terminal.

## Evoked response example

The following code is adapted from the MNE-Python [overvew of MEG/EEG analysis tutorial](https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/intro/10_overview.html#sphx-glr-auto-tutorials-intro-10-overview-py). **It will download a small example file and run a quick analysis.**

You can run this code directly in a Python session on BEAR within an activated MNE environment. The file will be saved into your RDS home directory (eg `/rds/homes/q/quinna`) unless specified otherwise - please change the `sample_data_folder` variable if you'd like to save this file elsewhere.

```python
import numpy as np
import mne

# This will download example data into your RDS home directory by default -
# change the next line if you want to save the file elsewhere!
sample_data_folder = '/rds/homes/q/quinna/mne-data/'
sample_data_raw_file = (sample_data_folder / 'MEG' / 'sample' /
                        'sample_audvis_filt-0-40_raw.fif')
raw = mne.io.read_raw_fif(sample_data_raw_file)

events = mne.find_events(raw, stim_channel='STI 014')

event_dict = {'auditory/left': 1, 'auditory/right': 2, 'visual/left': 3,
              'visual/right': 4, 'smiley': 5, 'buttonpress': 32}

reject_criteria = dict(mag=4000e-15,     # 4000 fT
                       grad=4000e-13,    # 4000 fT/cm
                       eeg=150e-6,       # 150 µV
                       eog=250e-6)       # 250 µV

epochs = mne.Epochs(raw, events, event_id=event_dict, tmin=-0.2, tmax=0.5,
                    reject=reject_criteria, preload=True)

conds_we_care_about = ['auditory/left', 'auditory/right',
                       'visual/left', 'visual/right']
epochs.equalize_event_counts(conds_we_care_about)  # this operates in-place
aud_epochs = epochs['auditory']
vis_epochs = epochs['visual']

vis_evoked = vis_epochs.average()

fig = vis_evoked.plot_joint()
fig[0].savefig('my-mne-evoked-example-grad.png')
fig[1].savefig('my-mne-evoked-example-mag.png')
fig[2].savefig('my-mne-evoked-example-eeg.png')
```

We can save this as `mne_python_example.py` as our core analysis script. This can be executed from a terminal session in which the appropriate python environment has been loaded. For example, we could open a 'BlueBEAR GUI' session, open a new terminal, change directory to the location of our script and run the following code:

```shell
module load bear-apps/2022a
module load MNE-Python/1.3.1-foss-2022a

python mne_python_example.py
```

At the end you should have some new figures created next to your script.

## MNE on the cluster

!!! warning
    There is currently a bug with this example to do with the automatic file downloading when running on the cluster. Running a similar example on your own data from RDS should work fine.

Alternatively, we can run our evoked responses analysis on the cluster. For this we'll need a job submission script. Let's use the following shell code to load the MNE module from BEAR and run our code.

```shell
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account quinna-example-project
#SBATCH --qos bbdefault

module purge; module load bluebear

module load bear-apps/2022a
module load MNE-Python/1.3.1-foss-2022a

python mne_python_example.py
```

!!! note
    We could equally create or load a virtual environment with a customised Python set-up in our job script. Here we use the built in BEAR module as it is all we need for the case in hand.

We can save the job script as `run_mne_python_example.sh` and submit it to the cluster using `sbatch`:

```shell
sbatch run_mne_python_example.sh
```

You can see the progress of the job using the 'Active Jobs' page on BEAR portal or by reading the log files.
