# Metal Detectors

It is imperative that neither the MEG Operator, nor the Participant bring any metal or magnetic objects with them into the MSR. 
**This is important for two reasons:**

* **Firstly**, the sensors (**SQUIDs**) are ultrasensitive in the sense that they can pick up changes in magnetic field in the range of femtoteslas. 
Bringing magnetic objects close to the gantry helmet can cause flux traps in the SQUIDs. This may lead to a long and expensive service break and delay the measurements.

* **Secondly**, bringing metal/magnetic objects into the MSR will distort collected measurements.

Therefore, before entering the MSR, it is very important to remove any potentially magnetic or metal objects. 
To help in checking this, two versions of metal detector are available to screen any person wanting to enter the MSR. Please use as instructed in their respective User Manuals.

!!! note "Poor usage/incorrect detection of metal may allow ferrous objects into the MSR potentially distorting acquired data subsequently collected. DON'T RUSH THE SCREENING!"
