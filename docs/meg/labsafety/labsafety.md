# Procedures to follow in an emergency

## **<span style="color:red">Helium is not life supporting!</span>**

If released into the air it poses a danger of suffocation. If a significant Helium leakage is detected our Oxygen Depletion Alarm (ODA) will sound, then :

- Immediately, calmly, evacuate MEG Control Room & MSR, and inform Sleep Control Room & Labs of their need to evacuate also, and instruct other staff/students not to enter the corridor.
- Arrange proper ventilation.
    - Open Fire Exit.
    - Open MEG Corridor door.
    - Open Sleep Lab doors and subsequently the windows (if possible).
- **<span style="color:blue">Beacon will flash/Alarm will sound - until Oxygen level is back above threshold.</span>**

!!! info "Our ODA is not connected to the building Fire Alarm system"
    Swipe access will not be disabled/corridor door will remain locked. **Use of the green "*no touch*" button** will be required to exit the corridor towards Reception.

    **If "*no touch*" button doesn’t work to exit corridor**, lift clear plastic flap, press **green emergency button**.<br />Lock will lose power/switch off, and door will pull/push open.<br /> 
    Button Reset key in MEG Key Safe – to be used by Ops. Comm. staff and trained MEG Operators as necessary.

The IHR tank room and MSR are protected by Oxygen Depletion sensors, with both a flashing Beacon and an 85dB Sounder.
