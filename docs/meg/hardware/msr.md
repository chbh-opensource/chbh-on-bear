### **Principles of MSR Door Operation**

The **MSR** door is locked by pressurized air, provided by the compressor in the plant room next door. <br />
On pressing the **Emergency Door Release** button, the air pressure is released, allowing free
movement of the two latches holding the door shut. <br />
The door will open approximately 20mm and can be pulled/pushed open the rest of the way. <br />
It is heavy so a reasonable amount of effort will be required. <br />
If for any reason the two latches are still locked after releasing the air pressure, the **Emergency Unlock** mechanism releases a 
spring that pulls the latches away from the lock hinges, allowing the door to open.

**To reset the latches**

Open the door wide enough to gain access to them. <br />
Insert the hex key into both slots and turn in the opposite direction of the arrow. <br />
Pull the latches out of their unlocked positions,
against the spring, until they lock. <br />
The spring is powerful, so pull hard!
