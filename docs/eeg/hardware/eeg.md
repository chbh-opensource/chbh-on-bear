# EEG at CHBH

EEG (electroencephalogram) is a non-invasive technique where electrodes are placed on a person's scalp to record electrical activity in the brain. It does this by recording changes in potential difference. EEG can capture hundreds of data points per second and therefore is a great tool for researching the chronology of mental processes. EEG is completely safe and pain free for participants.

The CHBH has XXX BioSemi's Active Two housed in YYYY labs.
