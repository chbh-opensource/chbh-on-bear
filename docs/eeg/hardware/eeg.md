# EEG at CHBH

<b>EEG</b> (electroencephalogram) is a non-invasive technique where electrodes are placed on a person's scalp to record electrical activity in the brain.

- It does this by recording changes in potential difference. 

- EEG can capture hundreds of data points per second and therefore is a great tool for researching the chronology of mental processes. 

- EEG is completely safe and pain free for participants.

The CHBH has 3 BioSemi's Active Two housed in 2 labs.
These are housed in the Gisbert Kapp EEG facility and the boothed EEG lab in 52 Pritchatt's Rd. Currently the latter affords simultaneous eye-tracking and prospectively, all EEG labs will.
In addition to these stand-alone systems, we have an MR compatible Brain Vision system and a built-in MEG compatible system.

We also have Polhemus Fastrak with Brainstorm to digitise EEG electrode positions and head shapes.
