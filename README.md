## Publishing

The documentation is automatically built and published to <https://ajquinn.github.io/chbh-on-bear> on every push to the `main` branch of this repository.

This is taken care of by the [`deploy` GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/AJQuinn/chbh-on-bear/tree/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

## Using `mkdocs`

### Creating a Development Environment and Installing `mkdocs`

To install all the required `mkdocs` Python packages, use the provided [requirements.txt](https://github.com/AJQuinn/chbh-on-bear/tree/main/requirements.txt) file. The recommendation for development is to do this inside a dedicated virtual environment:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/AJQuinn/chbh-on-bear
cd chbh-on-bear
python -m venv ./.venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Building

To build the documentation, use:

```shell
mkdocs build
```

### Testing

To test whether the documentation is building correctly, and whether all (internal) links are correct, use:

```shell
mkdocs build --strict
```

This command will exit with a non-zero exit code if `mkdocs` produces any errors or warnings.

### Previewing

To see a local preview of the rendered documentation in your browser, use

```shell
mkdocs serve
```

and click the link that is provided, for example:

```shell
INFO     -  Documentation built in 0.24 seconds
INFO     -  [17:52:07] Watching paths for changes: 'docs', 'mkdocs.yml'
INFO     -  [17:52:07] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

This preview of the rendered documentation will automatically refresh when the documentation sources are updated!
